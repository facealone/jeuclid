This directory contains support for auto-generating the W3C interfaces.

As the downloadable interfaces do not contain any documentation, the
are regenerated with instructions. The stylesheet here can be used as a base. The mathml-dom.xml file is taken straight from the MathML spec source.

Pleae note: the generated files must be formatted.

To generate the files run xsltproc:

  xsltproc int_gen.xslt mathml-dom.xml 

and then copy the results to the source directory, organize imports, and reformat.

WARNING: A little manual post-processing is still required!
