    <title>OpenOffice Support</title>

    <para>JEuclid has native support for reading files created with
    OpenOffice. All JEuclid apps can open and work with .odf files
    directly.</para>

    <para>OpenOffice up to 2.0.x used the "OpenSymbol" font with characters in
    the private Unicode range. A mapping table exists, and all characters
    should be mapped. If you encounter a non-working character, you may be
    missing a font (see file a <ulink url="./usage.html">usage</ulink>). If
    that does not help, please file a <ulink url="./issue-tracking.html">bug
    report</ulink>. Do not forget to attach the .odf file!</para>

    <para>OpenOffice ≥ 2.2 uses the standard Unicode character range. If you
    encounter a non-working character, please <ulink
    url="./usage.html">install a Unicode font</ulink>). The OpenSymbol font
    should work just fine, as long as its from OO ≥ 2.2</para>
