    <title>History</title>

    <para>This project started as a subproject from BMBF project(www.vs-c.de)
    in Germany. One of the big problems from HTML is, that it isn't possible
    to display mathematical equations in the browser. Since MathML initiative
    started at w3 consortium, it is possible to store mathematical formulas in
    XML documents, but there isn't a easy and cheap way to display this
    formulas. So this project launched with the destination to fill this
    gap.</para>

    <para>The project started as a component for the Apache Cocoon
    project(xml.apache.org). This component converted MathML documents to GIF
    images or SVG. So the user could easy write documents with embedding
    MathML fragments, and the component create in situ the GIF images. The SVG
    converter was used to create documents with embedding SVG fragments for
    e.g. the FOP to create PDF, or what else, documents.</para>

    <para>After being dormant for some time, the project was picked up again
    by Max in the summer of 2006. It has since then shifted its focus, away
    from a cocoon component to a more generic MathML solution.</para>
