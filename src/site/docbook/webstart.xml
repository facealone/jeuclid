    <para>Please note: This is a current snapshot. It is updated along with
    the deployment of the site, so please see the "Last Published" for an
    excact version information.</para>

    <para>The webstartable application does not include the advances export
    filters for most vector based formats. Please download the distribution if
    you need these plug-ins.</para>

    <para>Also note: The Webstart application is not trusted by a valid
    signature, and never will be. Webstart will complain about this fact. This
    application will run on your local computer and it will have access to
    your file system. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! (However, the risks are the same
    as downloading it and running it locally).</para>
